# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (\_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## Clean Code Practices

- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables
- Avoid deep nesting of code blocks
- Use comments to explain complex logic, not obvious code
- Remove commented-out code before committing

## User Interface and Experience

- Follow consistent design patterns and styles
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling when appropriate.
- Use Shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements
- Use pnpm for package management and scripts
